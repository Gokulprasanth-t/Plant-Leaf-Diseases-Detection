# Plant-Leaf-Diseases-Detection

### Overview

Plant Leaf Diseases Detection using YOLOv8 is object detection project which is developed for detecting and identify diseases affecting plant leaves. It leverages the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to analyze leaf images and provide predictions about the presence of diseases.

## Features

<b>*Disease Detection* </b>: The model take input image of a plant leaf from the real world throw camera and detect and localize diseases using the YOLOv8 algorithm.<br>
<b>*Accurate Localization* </b> : YOLOv8 provides precise bounding box coordinates for the detected diseases, aiding in identifying the affected areas on the leaf.<br>
<b> *High Performance* </b>: The system utilizes the YOLOv8 architecture, known for its speed and efficiency in object detection tasks.

## Requirements
To use the Plant Leaf Diseases Prediction system with YOLOv8, the following requirements should be met:<br><br>
    Input images should be of plant leaves with clear visibility and minimal obstructions.

### Limitations
<b>*Accuracy Limitations* </b>: Although YOLOv8 is known for its accuracy, it may occasionally provide incorrect predictions or miss some diseases, especially in cases of rare or uncommon diseases. It is always recommended to consult with a plant pathology expert for definitive diagnoses.<br>
<b>*Dependency on Image Quality* </b>: The accuracy of disease detection heavily relies on the quality and clarity of the input leaf images. Blurry or poorly captured images may lead to less reliable results.<br>
<b>*Training Data* </b>: The accuracy and coverage of disease detection depend on the training data used to train the YOLOv8 model. The system should be regularly updated with new and diverse datasets to improve its performance.

### Conclusion

The Plant Leaf Diseases Prediction system using YOLOv8 is a tool for assisting in disease detection, but it should not replace professional advice from plant pathology experts. Always consult with knowledgeable professionals for accurate diagnoses and appropriate treatments.
